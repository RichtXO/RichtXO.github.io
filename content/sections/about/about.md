As a Software Engineer with a strong background in full-stack development, I am passionate about creating secure, 
scalable, and efficient solutions that integrate seamlessly into the development lifecycle. Over the past two years, 
Iâ€™ve honed my skills in cybersecurity and DevSecOps, consistently demonstrating my ability to maintain strong 
cybersecurity postures across a wide range of tech stacks.

I thrive on the challenge of enhancing operational efficiency, particularly through the introduction of Quality of 
Life automation and the implementation of CI/CD pipelines. My approach is to embed security measures into every stage 
of the development process, ensuring that the solutions I help build are not only robust and secure but also optimized 
for performance.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me tinkering in my personal home lab, keeping networks secure with automations and IPS 
system, or prepping for the CISSP certification!

Tech stack? C, Java, Python, JavaScript - you name it.
